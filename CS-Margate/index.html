			<h1>Learn all about the <b>Cookie Run: Kingdom</b> world!</p>
			<div class="home-body">
				<p>Cookie Run: Kingdom is an RPG & city-building battle simulator. The game is mainly played by building the player's Cookie Kingdom and collecting Cookies using the game's gacha to fight in various game modes.</p>
				<p>At the beginning of the game, players receive a piece of land to build structures and amenities and aid the player in collecting resources. To unlock more items/resources, the player must level up the Cookie Castle, production buildings, and the Fountain of Abundance. Furthermore, players will have to build additional structures to use for either trading or upgrading. Players can produce resources for their Kingdom with various production buildings. The Cookie Castle can be upgraded when given enough items or cleared certain tasks, and this allows the player to expand the space available, and level up buildings and place more of them. The same applies to the offline reward-giving Fountain of Abundance. The player can also expand their land by using materials or fighting enemies in certain areas with their team.</p>
				<p>There are 83 playable Cookies in the game, used as the main fighting units for the game's various game modes. These Cookies, can be obtained from the game's gacha, which can be activated by spending Crystals, or specific event tokens for a specific Cookie. Crystals are earned through various methods in the game or can be purchased with real-life money. Cookies are placed in teams of up to five by the player. There are 7 rarities of cookie, ranging from Common to Ancient, and 8 classes of cookie that serve different functions in battle. For example, Support cookies provide a mix of healing, damage and temporary buffs for allies, and Magic cookies can debuff enemies. All cookies have a skill that can be activated, which causes damage, healing, or other effects. These skills have a short cooldown before being able to be used again.</p>
